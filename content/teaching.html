      <p>
        My teaching philosophy centers on creating an engaging and inclusive learning environment where students 
        feel empowered to explore economic concepts critically. I believe in combining theoretical foundations 
        with real-world applications to make economics relevant and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I emphasize active learning through problem-solving exercises, group discussions, and experimental methods 
        that allow students to see economic principles in action. My goal is to develop not just technical skills, 
        but also the analytical thinking and communication abilities essential for success in economics and beyond.
