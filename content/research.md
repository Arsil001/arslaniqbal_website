&nbsp;   <h3>Does Election Campaigns Affect Leaders' Behavior? (JMP)</h3>

&nbsp;   <p>This paper examines how campaign promises influence elected leaders' behavior. We use a novel laboratory experiment where leaders first set voters' tax rates and then decide their own contribution to a common fund. Importantly, leaders have discretion to either contribute to or withdraw (embezzle) from the common fund.</p>

&nbsp;   <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> With non-binding campaigns, candidates make generous promises but as elected leaders, the overwhelming majority renege and engage in embezzlement. Furthermore, making campaigns binding does not improve voters' payoffs or leader responsibility.</p>

&nbsp;   <h3>Does Leader Selection Mechanism Affect Leaders' Behavior?</h3>

&nbsp;   <p>Leaders often face a conflict of interest between self-interest and promoting social welfare. This study compares the overall effects of three leader selection mechanisms (random appointment, meritocracy, and election) on leaders' behavior.</p>

&nbsp;   <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Across all treatments, an overwhelming majority of leaders engage in opportunistic rather than responsible behaviors. The leader selection mechanism does not significantly affect leaders' embezzlement or socially responsible contribution. However, both meritocracy and election significantly increase tax evasion compared to random appointment.</p>
